# MetaSource — Intelligent Workforce Sourcing Platform

A platform that helps sourcing managers track contractor hiring requests without any manual effort. When admin edits a hiring request — updates a bill rate, fills a position, changes status — the system instantly detects it and notifies the relevant category manager. When a manager makes changes, admin gets notified. Both sides get real-time WebSocket push, AI-generated summaries, and email alerts. All automatic.

## What It Does

Five sourcing managers each own a category of hiring requests (engineering contractors, content & trust/safety, data operations, marketing/creative, corporate services). The platform:

- **Detects every change** — field-level tracking captures exactly what changed, by whom (admin or manager), and when
- **Routes notifications both ways** — admin edits notify the relevant manager; manager edits notify admin
- **Updates dashboards in real time** — WebSocket push means counts and stats refresh instantly, no page reload needed
- **Summarizes with AI** — instead of raw field diffs, managers get plain English summaries like "Bill rate for Senior DevOps increased from $75 to $95/hr"
- **Sends email alerts** — every change triggers an email to the other side via AWS SNS
- **Flags problems automatically** — AI scans for anomalies like price spikes, budget overruns, and stale requests

### What Managers See

| Page | What's There |
|------|-------------|
| **Home** | All 5 managers' active request counts, unfilled positions, and alert badges — updates live via WebSocket |
| **Dashboard** | Stats cards (total requests, unfilled positions, budget, critical priority), category pie chart, status bar chart, recent changes timeline |
| **Hiring Requests** | Full data grid with inline editing, status/priority dropdowns, search, filters, pagination, CSV upload |
| **Notifications** | All alerts with read/unread state, AI-generated summaries |
| **Change Log** | Complete audit trail of every field change across all requests |
| **Market Rates** | Benchmarking data for contractor rates |
| **AI Chat** | Ask questions in plain English — "What are the highest bill rates in engineering?" |

### Admin vs Manager

- **Admin** sees all 5 managers' data, can edit any category, access the data upload pipeline
- **Managers** are auto-redirected to their own dashboard, can only edit their category's requests
- **Notification routing is bidirectional** — when admin edits a request, the relevant category manager gets notified (WebSocket push, in-app notification, and email). When any manager edits a request, admin gets notified in real time via WebSocket. This applies across all 5 managers — every change triggers a notification to the other side

## How It Works

### The Change Flow (What Happens When Admin or a Manager Edits a Request)

```
Admin or manager changes status from OPEN to COMPLETED
    |
    v
Go Gateway receives PUT /api/requisitions/:id
    |
    |-- 1. Reads current values from database
    |-- 2. Compares old vs new (field-level diff)
    |-- 3. Saves change record (who, what, when)
    |-- 4. Updates the requisition
    |
    Then fires 4 things in parallel:
        |-- WebSocket broadcast to the category manager + admin (~50ms)
        |-- Creates notification in database for the category manager
        |-- Sends email via AWS SNS (~1-2s)
        |-- Triggers AI anomaly check (~2-5s)
    |
    v
The other side's browser receives WebSocket event
    |-- Dashboard refetches stats (counts drop because COMPLETED is excluded)
    |-- Home page refetches manager cards (same)
    |-- Toast notification appears
    |-- Notification badge increments
```

### Real-Time Updates

Every page that shows data listens for WebSocket events and silently refetches when something changes:

| Page | Listens For | What Refreshes |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Home page** | `change`, `notification`, `refresh` | All manager cards, total hiring requests, unfilled positions, alerts count |
| **Dashboard** | `change`, `notification` | All stat cards, charts, recent changes |
| **Hiring Requests** | `change` | Table data, total count, pagination |
| **Notifications** | `notification`, `read` | Notification list, unread badge in sidebar |

The WebSocket hub routes messages correctly:
- A change to an Engineering request goes to the Engineering manager's browser AND all admin browsers
- Admin connections receive events for every manager

### Active Request Counting

The "Total Hiring Requests" and "Unfilled Positions" numbers on both the home page and dashboard **only count active requests**. Requests with status COMPLETED or CANCELLED are excluded from these headline numbers. The status distribution chart on the dashboard still shows all statuses for the full picture.

### AI Features

| Feature | What It Does | When It Runs |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Change Summaries** | Turns "billRateHourly: 75 -> 95" into "Bill rate increased by 27% for Senior DevOps role" | Every 15 minutes (batch) |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Flags rate spikes >10%, budgets >90% used, requests stale >30 days | On each change + daily scan |
| **Chat Assistant** | Answers questions like "Which category has the most unfilled positions?" using 6 database query tools | On demand |
| **Data Upload Pipeline** | Ingests CSV, Excel, JSON, or messy text files — AI cleans and normalizes data | Admin-triggered |

### Email Alerts (AWS SNS)

Every change publishes to an SNS topic. Subscribe any email address via `POST /api/sns/setup` — AWS handles confirmation and delivery. No email server, no SMTP config, no worker process.

## Technical Details

### Why Go for the Gateway

Each requisition update triggers 7 operations (read old values, diff, save change, update row, WebSocket broadcast, create notification, SNS publish). In Go, the async operations are `go func()` — zero infrastructure. In Node.js, you'd need BullMQ + Redis for the same thing.

| Metric | Node.js/Express | Go (Gin) |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Requests/sec | 5,000–15,000 | 30,000–100,000+ |
| Memory per WebSocket connection | 50–100 KB | 2–4 KB |
| Background async work | Requires job queue + Redis | `go func()` — built in |
| 1,000 WebSocket connections | 50–100 MB RAM | 2–4 MB RAM |

### WebSocket Hub

- Connections register with a `managerId` (or "admin" for admin users)
- On broadcast: sends to the target manager's connections + all admin connections
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff on the client side
- Connection cleanup on disconnect

### Field-Level Change Tracking

The `track()` function in `requisitions.go` compares old vs new for each field. No AI — pure string comparison. Each change gets a type: STATUS_CHANGE, RATE_CHANGE, HEADCOUNT_CHANGE, BUDGET_CHANGE, or UPDATED.

### AI Data Upload Pipeline

4 stages for ingesting any file format:

1. **Parse** — Detect format, extract records (structured formats are programmatic; only unstructured text uses AI)
2. **Clean** — AI normalizes values in parallel batches ("eng" → ENGINEERING_CONTRACTORS, "$75/hr" → 75.0)
3. **Validate** — Pydantic schema enforcement (required fields, valid enums, correct types)
4. **Upsert** — Sequential DB insert with audit records and notifications

### Anomaly Deduplication

24-hour fingerprint-based dedup prevents notification spam. Each anomaly is hashed (category + type + key details). Same fingerprint within 24h is suppressed.

### Kubernetes Deployment

Three deployments in namespace `meta-test`. Traefik IngressRoute with TLS via cert-manager. Secrets: `openai-secret`, `aws-secret`.

Resource allocation (small dataset):

| Service | CPU (request/limit) | Memory (request/limit) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Frontend | 100m / 500m | 512Mi / 1.5Gi |
| Gateway | 25m / 200m | 128Mi / 256Mi |
| AI Service | 50m / 300m | 256Mi / 512Mi |

### Scaling

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Add a manager | INSERT one DB row + subscribe their email to SNS |
| Add a category | Add enum value — routing is automatic |
| More requests | PostgreSQL with pagination + indexing handles millions |
| More traffic | `kubectl scale --replicas` — all services are stateless |
| More notification channels | One `go func()` in the gateway — SNS already supports SMS, Lambda, SQS, HTTP |
